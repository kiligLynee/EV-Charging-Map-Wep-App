# EV-Charging-Map-Wep-App
This project aims to develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging map application to optimize the user charging experience. 
This project aims to develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging map application to optimize the user charging experience. Users can find nearby charging stations, obtain real-time charging station information, and estimate charging time and costs through this application. Additionally, the application will record user charging behaviors and analyze their choices and preferences using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized charging station recommendations.

Key Features:

User Registration and Login:

Users can register an account by providing their name, email, and password.
The login function allows users to access and manage their account information, such as editing car model and driving information, including battery capacity, maximum charging speed, and connector type.
Location Tracking and Charging Station Search:

The system automatically locates the user's current position.
It searches and displays nearby EV charging stations.
Charging Station Information Display:

Provides detailed information about charging stations, including location, connector type, number of connectors, fault status, charging speed, current real-time availability, price, and charging station ID.
Charging Time and Cost Estimation:

Estimates the time required to reach the charging station based on the user's current location.
Based on the user's input of current and desired battery levels, combined with car type information, it estimates the charging time and costs.
Provides 3-5 charging station options.
Nearby Facilities Recommendation:

Provides information about facilities near the charging station, such as cafes and supermarkets.
User Preference Analysis:

Records user choices and charging behaviors (e.g., preference for distance, cost, or a combination).
Analyzes user preferences using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized recommendations.
